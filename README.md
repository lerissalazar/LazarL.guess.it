guess it
The user is going to choose a level, and try to guess the random number based on what level they chose. They get as many tries as they need and the computer will 
output the amount of tries it took.
peer reviewed by Jovann Contreras: The code looks neat no errors it validates the level picking for the easy,medium and hard to thats great. It also validates the users input for guessing the number and tells the user to enter a number if a letter it entered. There are a few problems that can be fixed quick, those problems being that I can type in any number and will say I got it right everytime and sort of goes into a infinite loop. Another thing is it does not ask me to play again after I have guessed a number so somewhere in a while loop in the code needs to be fixed. The problems arent too bad to fix they just need to be cleaned up and added to the correct places of the code.
